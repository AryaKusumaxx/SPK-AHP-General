# svelte-hmr

HMR commons for Svelte 3.

This packages provides shared dependencies for implementing Svelte HMR in any bundler plugins.

If you want to _use_ HMR in your Svelte project, what you need is a HMR enabled plugin for your bundler (e.g. Rollup or Webpack). You'll find a list of available tools at the end of this doc.

On the other hand, if you are really developing a plugin... Sorry, no docs for now! Drop me a line, I'd be happy to help!

## Features

- update Svelte components in place

- preservation of component state, including local state (i.e. `let` vars in your components)

- inject CSS instead of doing a full replace when only the component's CSS has changed, with compatible HMR APIs (`rollup-plugin-hot`, Nollup, and Snowpack for now)

## Options

Those are the HMR options that are implemented by `svelte-hmr` itself, and so should be supported by any plugin listed bellow (especially if they include a link pointing to this section). How to pass those options is specific to each plugins, so refer to their specific docs on this point.

#### noReload

Type: `bool`<br>
Default: `false`

By default, `svelte-hmr` will trigger a full browser reload when it detects an error that will prevent subsequent HMR updates to be applied correctly. Set this to `true` to prevent automatic reloads. Note that Svelte Native does _not_ execute in a browser, and so this option has no effect there.

#### noPreserveState

**Deprecated: removed and default changed
